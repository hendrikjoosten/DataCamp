Linear regression and logistic regression are two of the most widely used statistical models. They act like master keys, unlocking the secrets hidden in your data. In this course, you’ll gain the skills you need to fit simple linear and logistic regressions. Through hands-on exercises, you’ll explore the relationships between variables in real-world datasets, including motor insurance claims, Taiwan house prices, fish sizes, and more. By the end of this course, you’ll know how to make predictions from your data, quantify model performance, and diagnose problems with model fit.

The response variable, the one you want to make predictions on, is also known as the dependent variable or the y variable. These two terms are completely interchangeable. Explanatory variables, used to explain how the predictions will change, are also known as independent variables or x variables. Again, these terms are interchangeable.

1. Chapter 1
Data engineers build data pipelines

1. Chapter 2
Building on these foundations, in the second chapter, we will then take things in order. We will study data storage: the different types of data structures, the central role that the SQL language plays in data engineering, and some storage solutions.

3. Chapter 3
Once data is stored, it is ready to be processed. This will be the topic of the third chapter, where we will dive deeper into processing methods and tools, scheduling, parallel computing and cloud computing.

## the steps
collect and ingest data (data engineers)
cleaning data (data analyst)
explore data (data scientest)
run experiments (machine learning engineer)


## The five Vs
Big data is commonly characterized by five Vs: 
 - volume (the quantity of data points), 
 - variety (type and nature of the data: text, image, video, audio), 
 - velocity (how fast the data is generated and processed), 
 - veracity (how trustworthy the sources are), and 
 - value (how actionable the data is). Data engineers need to take all of this into consideration.


## data engineer vs data scientist
DE ingest and store data
DS prepare data, explore and visual, experiment and predict

DE - set up DataBase
DS - access DataBase

DE - data pipeline
DS - use data pipeline

tech stacks are kinda similar tbh

## the data pipeline
flow data automatically from database to database

ETL = extract - transform - load


## data structures storage
structured data - easy to form relations - therefore stored in a relational database

## SQL 
RDBMS -
